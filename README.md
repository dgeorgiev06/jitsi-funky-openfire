lib-jitsi-meet — a low level javascript client library for managing Jitsi Meet Video conferences

react-native-webrtc — provides web browsers and mobile applications with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs)

react-native-callkit — utilises the new iOS 10 framework CallKit for VOIP apps to interact with the iPhone UI

mobx-state-tree — a library that helps you organize your application states in a very structured manner. It allows you to create a component model, but for your data

react-native-gifted-chat — chat UI for React Native
